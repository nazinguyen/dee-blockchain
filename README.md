# DEE Blockchain - Decentralized Identity and Credential System

## Overview

DEE Blockchain is a comprehensive decentralized identity (DID) and credential management system built on the Polygon blockchain. It provides a robust infrastructure for managing digital identities, issuing verifiable credentials, and handling identity-related operations in a secure and decentralized manner.

## Core Features

### Decentralized Identity (DID) Management
- Create and manage decentralized identities
- Update DID documents and metadata
- Delegate management
- Batch operations support
- IPFS integration for off-chain storage

### Credential Management
- Issue verifiable credentials 
- Revoke and transfer credentials
- Credential metadata storage
- Batch credential operations
- Advanced validation and verification

### Security Features
- Role-based access control
- Timelock system for critical operations
- Rate limiting and DOS protection
- Emergency pause functionality
- Advanced input validation
- Reentrancy protection

### Developer Features
- Gas-optimized operations
- Comprehensive event system
- Frontend/Backend integration APIs
- Advanced query capabilities
- Extensive testing suite
